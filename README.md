# LeanTouch - CSharp tests

This project contains C# AltTester® tests for a project using the New Input System.
The tested actions are: swipe, multipoint swipe, tap at coordinates and begin/end touch.

## Before running the tests
To run the tests, you must include the AltTester® Unity SDK in the project. To do that, you can choose between the following ways:
1. Add the AltTester® Unity SDK submodule to the project
    - use ``git submodule update --init`` command to pull the git submodule;
    - make sure that the submodule added is on the master branch (you can use the following command ``git checkout master`` in the <i>Assets/AltTester-Unity-SDK</i> folder);
    - also, if you already have the project, you should make a ``git pull`` on the master branch, in order to ensure that you are using the latest version of AltTester.

2. Download AltTester® Unity SDK and import it into Unity 
    - download the AltTester® Unity SDK from the AltTester® website (https://alttester.com/downloads/) or using this link https://alttester.com/app/uploads/AltTester/sdks/AltTesterUnitySDK.unitypackage;
    - import the package into the project (drag-n-drop the package in the Assets folder);
    - a pop-up will appear, select All and click on Import.

## Run the tests

You can open the project in the Unity Editor and run the tests from AltTester® Editor window.

The tests can be found in Editor folder in the AltTester_NIS_tests class.
